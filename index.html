      <h2>About</h2>
      <h4>HouseART Is a platform that allows its subscribers to change their home interior by renting artwork for a monthly fee. Not only that users can lend other people's artwork to refresh their homes, but can also profit by renting artwork in their possession to other people.  Our company also offers help from the interior designers, who take care that each artwork fits in well with the others as well as and with your ambience.<h4>
